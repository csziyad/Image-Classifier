## Project: Image_classifier

### overview
Train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers.

The project divided into two parts:

**part one** is the notebook where we will:
- Make a pipeline to process the input image.
- Build and train the classifier.
- Save the classifier.

**part two** is to convert the model into an application that others can use. The application is a Python script that runs from the command line.


### requirements
- Python
- NumPy
- tensorflow
- tensorflow_datasets
- tensorflow_hub
- Matplotlib
- You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)
- [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) has these packages pre-installed.


### Data

The Oxford Flowers 102 dataset is a consistent of 102 flower categories commonly occurring in the United Kingdom. Each class consists of between 40 and 258 images. The images have large scale, pose and light variations. In addition, there are categories that have large variations within the category and several very similar categories.[oxford_flowers102](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/oxford_flowers102).
